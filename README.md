## ANTMN_with_BERTopic

The following is an implementation of Walter and Ophir's ANTMN computational frame analysis method 
using the BERTopic topic modeling library. The aim of the method is to automatically generate frame packages used in 
news articles based on how certain themes are mentioned across news sources.
